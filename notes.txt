1. Diffusion:

Definition

a) Movement of molecules from a region of its higher 
   concentration to a region of a lower concentration
b) As a result of the Brownian motion

Importance

a) Obtain required substances to live
b) Getting rid of waste products
c) Allows gas exchange for respiration

--------------------------------------

2. Osmosis:

Definition

a) Diffusion of water molecules from dilute
   to a more concentrated solution
b) across a partially permeable membrane

--------------------------------------

3. other terms for water levels:

a) shrunk (reason: higher internal concentration)
b) turgid (reason: lower internal concentration)
c) animal cells bursts
d) plant cells survive cuz cell wall
e) when bloated, less oxygen, 
worse respiration, portability

1. Biological Molecules:

 Molecules in living organisms
  a) Hydrogen, sulfur, nitrogen, carbon.

 
Molecules with carbon/hydrogen/oxygen
 a) Carbohydrates, some lipids/fats


binds to three fatty acid molecules
 a) Glycerol


Test/Food group
 
Benedict's -- Glucose 
(P -- from blue to green/orange/red)
Lodine           Starch 
(N -- brown/orange P -- blue/black)
Ethanol emulsion lipids
DCPIP            Vitamin C
Biuret           Protein


Facts:
Only contain carbon/hydrogen/oxygen
Principal nergy source in the animal diet

carb/protein:
+ contain carbon/hydrogen/oxygen
- protens contain nitrogen/sulfur
-carb do not contain nitr/sulfur

ENZYMES

Proteins made of amino acids.
Biological catalyst.
to work rapidly, correct temperature
and pH.

Amylase:
enzyme to break down carbs
stop working in acidic cond

--------------------------
Works in acidic:
protease/pepsin/trypsin

acid kills bacteria

2 STATES!!!!!
Optimum enzyme  ---- peak 
Denatured enzyme --- least efficient, 
                     permanent

PLANT NUTRITION

HOW
 via root hair cells
 through the cell walls
 through partially permeable me
 water travels by osmosis

FUNCTIONS
 support of cells
 transportation of mineral ions
 solvent to dissolve sugars/minrl-ions
 coolant for optimum temp for plant to grow
 
WATER
 transported in the xylem
 mostly lost via stomata

CHLOEOPLASTS
 contain chlorophyll
 transfers light energy into
             chemical energy 

PHOTOSYNTHESIS
 requires CO2
 diffusion via stomata
 number of leaves/ size of the plant

EQUATION
 reactants - Carbon dioxide + water
 products  - glucose + oxygen

HUMAN DIET

high-fat diet
Obesity/Coronary heart disease CHD


WATER
 is a solvent

DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Mouth
small intestine 

ENZYME SHAPE IMPORTANCE
Enzymes have active site
so the form must be complementary
to the substrate/starch/product
so starch can bind to the enzyme
shape of ac/si is only capable to 
fit one substrate



FOOD BREAKDOWM
Ingestion - food into mouth
Absorption - digested food mol
            move through the wall
            of intestine
Assimilation - dig. food mol moves into
               the cells of body
Chemical digestion -large into slam soluble
                    molecules


PHYSICAL DIGESTION 
churning action of Stomach
Chewing by teeth
